Research Lab WiSe23-24: Enabling circular and sustainable clothing in your wardrobe

---

Todayâ€™s e-commerce landscape is consumer-centric, and among them, the fashion industry wields substantial influence. The fashion industry shapes and dictates many societal norms but is also a significant contributor towards environmental pollution. Heightened awareness among consumers regarding the social and ecological consequences of their purchases has pushed the demand for sustainable and ethical fashion options. Yet, the scarcity of easily accessible and reliable information on product sustainability creates an intention-behavior gap. To address this challenge, a new framework is needed that can leverage domain expertise to discern sustainable products and facilitate consumer access to them.

In response, our research lab endeavors, through this paper, to devise a content-based sustainability-focused recommendation algorithm for 'esprit.com,' a leading apparel retailer. Our approach extends the work of Satinet and Fouss [DOI: 10.3390/su14031334], utilizing supervised machine learning to extrapolate findings from life cycle assessment studies, thereby enabling the evaluation of clothing product sustainability with limited online retailer data.

Leveraging a dataset comprising clothing product life cycle attributes and corresponding environmental impact data, we trained a recommendation system employing three supervised machine learning algorithms. Notably, the random forest algorithm emerged as the most effective, with an average accuracy of 82 percent. The resultant recommendation system stands poised to benefit consumers with sustainable product suggestions, thus cultivating informed and responsible shopping behaviors.
